# Meeting Slides

This is the repo for storing my weekly meeting slides, regarding the research topic of DOE (design of experiments) and SOA (strong orthogonal arrarys). 

The sildes are created using [marp](https://marp.app/). Changes between each week are tracked by different git branches.

A pre-commit hook is also included to automatically export the slides markdown file into pdf, if it is modified.
