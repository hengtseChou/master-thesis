# Research - SOA of strength 3 with 3 levels

This is the repo for storing my research material (code related), regarding the research topic of DOE (design of experiments) and SOA (strong orthogonal arrarys).

The sildes are created using [marp](https://marp.app/), a tool that allow creating slides with markdown syntax. Changes between each week are tracked by different git branches. A plugin to hide slides is included (Install with https://gist.github.com/yhatt/13a9f52c96821ae34c3de5f732f305df).

A pre-commit hook is also included to automatically export the slides markdown file into pdf, if it is modified.
